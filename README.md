# Developer Apologies

## Description

Scripts to facilitate discovery and analysis of developer apologies in GitHub issues and pull-requests.

## Motivation

Identifying apologies is a way to identify self-admitted **mistakes**. Once identified, we can catalog developer mistakes into one of two taxonomies:

1. Human Error Taxonmy: Slips, Lapses, Errors.
2. Errors of Omission, Commission, and Realization.

Cataloging developer mistakes yields a knowledge-base to help developers learn from their mistakes.
